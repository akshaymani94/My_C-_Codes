    //Polymorphism
    // 1. one name and multiple forms
    // eg : Function overloading, operator overloading, virtual functions

/*
Polymorphism is of two types
1. Complie time polymorphism 
    Here binding is done

2. Run time polymorphism
    Here binding is not done. Is decided based on the type of the pointer 
 Complie time polymorphism is achieved using
 1. Function overlaoding
 2. Operator overloading

 Run time polymorphism is achieved using
 1. Virtual functions
